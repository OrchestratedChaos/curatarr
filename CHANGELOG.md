# Changelog

All notable changes to Plex Recommender will be documented in this file.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-02

### Changed
- **Utils package refactoring** — Split 2500+ line `utils.py` into focused modules:
  - `utils/config.py` - Configuration utilities
  - `utils/display.py` - Output formatting, logging, colors
  - `utils/tmdb.py` - TMDB API functions
  - `utils/cache.py` - Cache I/O operations
  - `utils/labels.py` - Label management
  - `utils/scoring.py` - Similarity scoring functions
  - `utils/counters.py` - Counter utilities
  - `utils/helpers.py` - Miscellaneous helpers
  - `utils/plex.py` - Plex-specific utilities
  - `utils/__init__.py` - Re-exports 72 items for backwards compatibility

- **Scoring formula overhaul** — Changed from averaging to sum with diminishing returns
  - Multiple weak keyword matches now add up instead of averaging down
  - A movie with 15 matching keywords scores well even if each is partial
  - Typical scores now in 70-85% range instead of 20-50%

- **Weight redistribution** — When a component has no matches (e.g., unknown director),
  its weight now redistributes proportionally to components that did match

- **New default weights:**
  - Keywords: 50% (was 45%) — Most predictive signal
  - Genre: 25% (was 20%) — Baseline preference
  - Actor: 20% (was 15%) — Cast preferences
  - Director: 5% (was 15%) — Most people don't pick by director
  - Language: 0% (was 5%) — Removed due to unreliable data

### Fixed
- **format_media_output() signature** — Fixed function parameter names and order to match callers
  - Changed `media_info` to `media` parameter name
  - Added missing `show_director` and `show_genres` parameters

- **Duplicate log messages** — Warnings and errors now appear only once
  - Enabled ColoredFormatter for colored log output
  - Removed redundant print() calls from log_warning/log_error

- **Case sensitivity bugs** — Genres, directors, and actors now match case-insensitively
  - "Drama" now correctly matches "drama" in user profiles
  - Fixed major scoring undercount issue

- **External recommender cache** — Now updates scores for existing cached items
  - Previously only added new items, never updated scores
  - Scores now reflect current user profile

- **Collection smart sorting** — Collections now replace lower-scoring items with
  higher-scoring ones, not just fill gaps

### Added
- **Unit test suite** — 101 tests covering utility functions
  - Tests for plex extraction, counters, labels, cache, helpers, scoring
  - Run with: `python3 -m pytest tests/ -v`

- **Base classes** — Created `base.py` with abstract base classes for future refactoring:
  - `BaseCache` - Common cache functionality for movies and TV shows
  - `BaseRecommender` - Common recommender functionality

- **Type hints** — Added consistent type hints across utility modules:
  - `utils/helpers.py`, `utils/display.py`, `utils/plex.py`
  - Added `Any`, `Dict`, `List`, `Set`, `Tuple`, `Optional` type annotations

- Per-item weight redistribution — If a specific movie's director isn't in your
  profile, that 5% weight goes to keywords/genres/actors instead

### Removed
- **Unused imports** — Cleaned up unused imports from main modules:
  - `movie_recommender.py` - Removed `plexapi.server`, `PlexServer`, `Counter`, `quote`, `timedelta`, `math`
  - `tv_recommender.py` - Removed `plexapi.server`, `PlexServer`, `Counter`, `timedelta`, `math`
  - `base.py` - Removed `json`, `Counter`, unused utility imports
